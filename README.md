# Arduino 101 Course

Welcome to this introductory course on robotics. The challenges assume you have the [Arduino Mega 2560 R3 Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EWNUUUA?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_sms_apin_dp_3RX4GNA5K98JP3G2W0SX&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_sms_apin_dp_3RX4GNA5K98JP3G2W0SX&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_sms_apin_dp_3RX4GNA5K98JP3G2W0SX&starsLeft=1&skipTwisterOG=1&newOGT=1), or something with similar hardware.

## Actuators
Actuators are components which produces some kind of physical output. For example, an LED produces light, hence it is an actuator. So are buzzers and motors, and you will have the chance to work with both in this lesson.

In the Actuators lesson, you will see a `Challenges.md` file, which has a number of projects for you to try (the challenges get progressively harder!).

## Sensors
Sensors are components which detect physical stimuli. For example, a button sends a signal when it is pressed, hence it is a sensor. Other sensors include ultrasonic sensors, flex sensors, temperature sensors and humidity sensors.

In the Sensors lesson, you will see a `Challenges.md` file, which has a number of projects for you to try (the challenges get progressively harder!).

## Simple Burglar Alarm

This capstone project combines the knowledge from the previous two lessons. We will make an alarm system which beeps and flashes when someone gets too close. See the details in the [`README`](03%20Simple%20Burglar%20Alarm/README.md) file of this project.
