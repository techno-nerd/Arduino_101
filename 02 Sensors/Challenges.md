# Sensor Programming Challenges

<i>Sensors are devices which detect changes in the physical environment. This includes buttons, ultrasonic sensors and temperature sensors</i>

No programmer is expected to memorize everything. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/) for information, and search up anything else you need.

0. Make an LED turn on when a button is pressed

1. Measure and print the distance using an ultrasonic sensor

2. Print the temperature and humidity of the room every second in the Serial Monitor

3. Print the temperature and humidity of the room every time a button is pressed

4. Print the temperature and humidity of the room every second, and toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius (the button should be unaffected by the delay) 

5. Free choice: Learn how to use and build a project using either a potentiometer, a membrane keyboard or a joystick. You can even try to control LEDs based on the input from the sensor.
