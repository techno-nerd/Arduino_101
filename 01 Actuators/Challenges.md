# Actuator Programming Challenges

<i>Actuators is just a fancy word for anything that produces a physical change. This includes LEDs, servo motors and buzzers.</i>

No programmer is expected to memorize everything. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/) for information, and search up anything else you need.


0. Wire a blue LED and make it blink. Now try the same with a buzzer (beep periodically). What are the similarities and differences between the two?

1. Turn one LED on at full power and another one at 50% power

2. Make a series of 3 LEDs turn on one after another, with a 1 second delay between two LEDs

3. Make a servo sweep back and forth

4. Make a servo sweep back and forth. Have a red LED turn on when it reaches 180 degrees, a yellow LED turn on when it reaches 0 degrees and a green LED turn on when it reaches -180 degrees. Turn off all 3 LEDs 1 second after reaching the end, and start the loop 1 second later.

5. Make a servo sweep back and forth. Use the RGB LED to make it red at 180 degrees, yellow at 0 degrees and green at -180 degrees. Turn off the LED 1 second after reaching the end, and start the loop 1 second later.
